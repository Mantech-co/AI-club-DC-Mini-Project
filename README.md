# AI-club-DC-Mini-Project
RAG PDF implementation 

Brief overview:
Started the project journey by learning about vector embeddings and different embedding techniques and relevance ranking
algorithms. 
Explored TF-IDF, GloVe embedding and BM-25

The project itself is a Gemini based LLM with RAG capability where context is generated by processing several PDFs.
The specific use-case in mind was for Rules Quiz assistance for competition-teams at IITM and also as a customer service assistant for businesses.
